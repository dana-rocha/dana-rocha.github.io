  <h3> Education </h3>
  <p>I recently graduated from Northeastern University,
    earning a <strong>M.S. in Bioinformatics with a Data Analytics Concentration</strong>.
    For undergrad, I also attended Northeastern and earned a <strong>B.S. in Biochemistry </strong>in 2018. </p>
  <p>My informatics training was interdisciplinary - combining Biology,
    Computer Science, and Statistics. During my Master's program, I learned
    how to code in Perl and Python.
    I gained experience with <strong>unit testing, file manipulation, program design,
    and implementation</strong>.</p>
  <p>My data science training was focused on <strong>data wrangling, data visualization,
    and regression</strong> applied to biological data and social science data. I also
    have experience using machine learning techniques such as <strong>Clustering,
    Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.</strong>
    R is my language of choice when it comes to data science.
    I'm a big fan of tidyverse - particularly the ggplot2 package. </p>
